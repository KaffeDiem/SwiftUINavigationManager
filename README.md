# NavigationManager

### Why
In `iOS 16` the `NavigationStack` was introduced. This had made navigation in SwiftUI much more pleasant to use. However, there is still room for improvement. This is where the `NavigationManager` comes in handy.

### Supports
##### iOS
`iOS 16` is required and `iOS 16.2` is recommended.
